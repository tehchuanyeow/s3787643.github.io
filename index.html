									<p>I started having an interest in IT when I was 8, but only really started coding when I turned 15.
										What sparked my interest was from <em>Minecraft</em> <sub>screw off Fortnite</sub> where I learned
									how to host my own server, create my own Plugins & <sub>earn</sub> some $$ for ranks. I probably
									earned about $200+ from it alone & even started selling my plugins for $100 each (which people actually bought!)</p>

									<h1 class="major">My Project Idea</h1>
									<h2>The Overview</h2>
									<p>I had an idea for a third person shooter styled linear-based game with choices that shape and influence the gameplay, as well as a <em>"Personality"</em>
										 meter. The gameplay will be similar to that of most triple-A title games with moving and shooting capabilities (Ex: The Last of Us, Grand Theft Auto, etc.), choices will appear according to scripted
										events and each choice made by the player will make their character turn more evil or good from this <em>"Personality"</em> meter, but also affect the characters around the player, meaning that There
										is always a catch to who you emphasise more and what the player makes of to be more of a priority.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="panel color1 intro span-4">
									<h2 class="major">Motivation</h2>
									<p>My motivation behind the idea of this game is derived from story-based games, such as Telltale's Walking Dead, or Dontnod's Life is Strange. But the choices never
										really seemed to actually matter. Meaning like you could save a character from dying in one episode, only for them to die in another way in the next episode due to problems
										with continuity, or that they aren't major characters anymore to save the developers time from the workload of having to constantly put in alternate scenarios for alternate
										choices. I feel like with my game, I could do just that, and more.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="panel color1-alt intro span-4">
									<h2 class="major">Game Description</h2>
									<p>The story and gameplay will influence the whole game and not just choices, but the character's <em>"Personality",</em>
										which could lead to very different alternate endings with at least multiple outcomes with multiple characters of which can be determinant to save. My focus will be more on the
										<em>either or</em> situation. Meaning you either save one character or the other and major events would occur based on such a choice, while also affecting your character's <em>Personality</em>.
										The different outcomes & gameplay are based entirely on the types of characters that you choose to help and how high/low your <em>Personality</em> meter is. There is no such thing as being a directly good/bad player in this game, meaning that it is more about judge of characters and their ulterior motives, sort of like a psychological game. The third person shooting mechanic will deeply involve stealth mechanics and not every scenario presented will necessarily have shooting in it. But there is no game over for failing certain obstacles, meaning that if something is missed or failed to get through, it will simply play as an effect on the character's <em>personality</em> both positively and negatively.</p>
								</div>

								<div class="panel color1 intro span-4">
									<h2 class="major">The Gameplay</h2>
									<p>Gameplay will focus on <em>"Personality Meter"</em> & <em>Choices</em> in a linear-based storyline that although are just factors, play a major role on the influence of the gameplay and direction of the Story of the Game, as well as the scenarios that differ. The view for the player is Third-Person. However, some of the scenarios involved do not always involve weapon mechanics, but relies more on stealth. There is also optional customisability to change the looks of the character. The different scenarios involved will also contain different choices for players to make for their character, such as influencing relationships in the game or a certain set of skills for other purposes, etc. And the <em>Personality Meter</em> will determine the final ending, together with a few foreshadowing moments that display the current emphasis on how good/bad the character currently is.</p>
								</div>
								
								<div class="panel color1-alt intro span-4">
									<h2 class="major">Scenarios</h2>
									<p>The different scenarios that can occur but are not limited to are:</p>
									<table class="alt">
											<thead>
												<tr>
													<th>Scenario</th>
													<th>Effects</th>
												</tr>
											</thead>
											<tbody>
												<tr>
													<td>Relationships</td>
													<td>Major decision that directly influences relationship and "Personality" Meter in some circumstances</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>"Good" Choices</td>
													<td>Might have a Positive impact on the Player, but might also negatively affect other factors</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>"Bad" Choices</td>
													<td>Might have a Negative impact on the Player, but could also assist other factors</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Personality Meter</td>
													<td>Influences what scenarios that will take place in the future if the player chooses to continue their current route</td>

										</table>

								<div class="panel color1 intro span-4">
									<h2 class="major">The Storyline</h2>
									<p>It is still a rough concept, but the storyline will take place throughout 20 in-game weeks that will have a playable and customisable Main Character, followed by different side characters who will make their first appearances that take place during the events of the game. Their presence and relationships with the player throughtout the rest of the game from there on will be determined by the choices that the player themselves will make to choose between their character and the relationship choices (Also known as 'Determinant Characters' in common gaming terms). The main character will be present throughout all situations and they will not be able to be killed off until the ending if the player gets certain endings. The storyline will also consist of shooting, stealth, fighting and other events that can also be determined if the player chooses to carry out these certain scenarios. There will be a tutorial in the beginning that will cover all of these events for the player for ease of gameplay in future events.</p>
								</div>
								
								<div class="panel color6-alt intro span-4">
									<h2 class="major">Tools and Technologies</h2>
									<p>To make a game with such a massive scope will require a beefy game engine, such as Unity or Havok. They are good as they now offer real-time rendering techniques! Meaning that cinematics/cutscenes can be rendered in real time. It makes the graphics look more stunning and immerses the player into the game. They also support C#, which is a primary language that I have learnt and gotten a chance to use since my years in Cert IV, about 3 years ago. The game would be designed exclusively for PCs only and might expand to consoles too if it receives good feedback.</p>
								</div>
								
								<div class="panel color2-alt intro span-4">
									<h2 class="major">Skills Required</h2>
									<p>The skills required to develop my Game would be to have an extensive knowledge of C# and/or other Object-Oriented Programming languages, a wide understanding of Artificial Intelligence and 3D Modelling and Designers for the characters and the different set extensions throughout the Game. And those are the most feasible things required to create this project. But it would mean hiring external designers for a project that although may be ambitious, might also not turn out as good as it was envisioned, therefore, it wouldn't be the right time to contribute at the moment.</p>
								</div>
								
								<div class="panel color0 intro span-4">
									<h2 class="major">Outcome</h2>
									<p>If this Game Project is ever successful, the outcome I imagine would be quite widespread pretty fast. As no other game has had any potential so far in making alternate situations along with complex situations with complex characters. The current problems with story-based games are that characters often don't really engage in anything new or "alternate" despite different situations that are made. A good example would be TellTale's The Walking Dead. Where no matter which character the player chooses to save in the First episode, it really would not matter for they would just die in the Second episode due to continuity issues. The impact that this game would have would be to consider every single factor and develop them accordingly that not only keeps the player engaged on the outcomes that their choices have made, but also immerses them into the experience that they have made so far. Ultimately this will raise the bar for future games (especially for those in story-telling) if it succeeds.</p>
